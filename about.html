<p>OPTA-BETA (Operationalized <strong><em>Theory of Action</em></strong>) is a powerful, open-source web-based application designed for organizations in the education sector that pursue overarching goals through partnerships with multiple service providers, each with its own goals and strategies. OPTA will provide such “intermediary organizations” and their partners with a structured framework for articulating individual and collective goals and associated strategies, identifying aligned indicators of success, and using the results to paint a richly diagnostic picture of the efficacy of the organization and each partner at short intervals. Organizations that may find OPTA useful include foundations, “harbor-masters,” other multi-partner networks, and state and local departments of education that mobilize their own cohorts of school-support operators.</p>
                        
                        
<h3>I.  Theory of Action</h3>
					

<p>A Theory of Action describes the relationship between an organization’s actions and the outcomes it hopes to achieve. It communicates an organization’s primary objective—its raison d’être—and the strategy it expects to follow to fulfill that objective. Designing an effective Theory of Action requires two critical steps:</p> 

  <p class="setOff"><strong>Step One:</strong> Articulate a clear and measurable objective.<br><strong>Step Two:</strong> State the actions that, together, will achieve that objective.</p> 

<p>These first two steps can be embodied in an “if-then” statement:</p> 

<div class="diagram_toa"><div class="stepBox"><em><strong>If</strong></em> we do “X Action”…</div>
<div class="stepBtw">+</div>
<div class="stepBox">… and “Y Action” …</div>
<div class="stepBtw">=</div>
<div class="stepBox">… <em><strong>then</strong></em> we will achieve “Z Objective.”</div></div>

<p><h4>For example, here is an expression of “Organization A’s” Theory of Action:</h4></p>

<div class="diagram_toa"><div class="stepBox"><em><strong>If</strong></em> Organization A attracts high-performing teachers...</div> 
<div class="stepBtw">+</div>
<div class="stepBox">…that effectively support schools and districts...</div> 
<div class="stepBtw">=</div>
<div class="stepBox">…<strong><em>then</em></strong> Organization A will improve achievement among underserved students.</div></div>

<p><h4><strong>An effective Theory of Action…</strong></h4></p>

<p class="setOff"><strong>… is relatively stable but subject to modification.</strong> An organization’s Theory of Action will rarely change drastically over time, but an effective Theory of Action statement should invite multiple, iterative modifications. As a Theory of Action is implemented and data points are collected, the Theory of Action statement should be updated, as relevant, to reflect lessons learned. For example, an organization may at first silently assume a necessary precondition to the effective operation of its actions or a supplemental link between those actions and the intended outcome. Alternatively, that organization may silently expect certain prerequisites to be put in place by someone else. When the absence of that action or link contributes to the failure of the organization’s actions to generate their intended effect, the organization will realize that its Theory of Action—and the practical steps it or others must take—will have to change in order to supply the missing prerequisite. Through this iterative process of change, the Theory of Action gains precision and accuracy, and the organization is better able to implement and evaluate strategies.</p>

<p class="setOff"><strong>… includes measurable actions and objectives.</strong> The Theory of Action should be premised on actions and objectives that can be measured in a meaningful way. Even if the most accurate and valid metrics may not be available, using strong proxies can help an organization evaluate and track progress along their Theory of Action.</p>

<p class="setOff"><strong>… contemplates both leading and lagging indicators of success.</strong> Often, an organization’s program and services are offered in pursuit of meaningful long-term impact that takes time to actualize. A Theory of Action should therefore contemplate some leading indicators that are reasonably strong predictors of the desired long-term impact. Conversely, if an organization’s program and services are focused almost entirely on producing short-term results, it is critical to consider the long-term implications of such results.</p>

<p class="setOff"><strong>… demonstrates a causal relationship between actions and objectives, as well as leading and lagging indicators of success.</strong> The Theory of Action statement should present what at first is a theory of a causal relationship between actions and outcomes. An organization’s goals and objectives should be logically connected to, and causally linked to, the organization’s primary activities and actions. The iterative process of change described above reflects the organization’s acquisition of knowledge about how its causal theory lines up with—and can be changed to line up better with—actual practice.</p>

<h4><em>What indicators may be used to track progress implementing a Theory of Action?</em></h4> 

<p>An organization’s ultimate impact varies based on its mission. In some cases, an organization may hope its ultimate impact will be improved school leadership, teacher instruction, parent initiative, or school level finances. In other cases, improvements in student test scores, high school graduation rates, or success in the first year of college might be the desired impact. Each of these is a <strong>lagging indicator</strong>, which is used to mark the achievement of the organization’s long-term goals and may take several years to actualize. Lagging indicators are necessary, of course, but often will not provide information that is sufficiently timely and contextualized to reveal the short- and mid-term success of an organization’s work—i.e., whether the intermediate changes the organization expects to occur, in order to set the stage for or drive the ultimate impacts, are occurring. Organization’s lagging indicators are not always expected to align with Public Square’s Impact measures, but may directly or indirectly affect them.</p>

<div class="row">
  <div class="6u 12u(mobilep)">
    <h3>Lagging Indicator</h3>
    <p class="setOff2">Reveals success achieving long-term goals and confirms trends</p> 

<p class="setOff2">May be used to confirm or contradict expected outcomes and effectiveness of programs </p>
  </div>
  <div class="6u 12u(mobilep)">
    <h3>Leading Indicator</h3>
    <p class="setOff2">Reveals if a Theory of Action is being implemented well</p>

<p class="setOff2">Provides timely and contextualized information that can drive short- and mid-term adjustments to actions</p>

<p class="setOff2">Predicts future change in a lagging indicator</p>
  </div>
</div>

<p>Determining whether the important intermediate changes and effects are occurring, which in turn helps to predict future change in a <strong>lagging indicator</strong>, requires the use of <strong>leading indicators</strong>. For example, because increases in student attendance or decreases in teacher absenteeism often correlate with increases in student achievement, an organization’s Theory of Action may call for efforts to improve student attendance and reduce teach absenteeism, with the expectation that increases in student achievement will follow. In that case, changes in a school’s average student attendance and teacher absenteeism rates can serve as leading indicators of success that reveal whether the organization’s Theory of Action is being implemented properly and provide an early indication of whether student achievement levels can be expected to improve in the following months or even years.</p>
