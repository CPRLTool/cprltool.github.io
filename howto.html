                        <h3>I. Overview</h3>
						<p>
This manual is designed to guide you through the process of using OPTA to describe your organization’s Theory of Action for an initiative. This manual will also walk you through the steps to articulate the outcomes you hope to achieve, to understand how your work relates to your initiatives broader objectives, and to define a clear and measurable strategy to achieve your stated outcomes.</p>

<p>The process begins by giving you the chance to articulate a Theory of Action that describes the Inputs, Actions, and intended Outcomes of your initiative and how they relate to your 
desired Impact. The process also asks you to identify the metrics and indicators you will track to assess your progress against your goals.  Together, you and your partner organization will monitor the indicators you have chosen to track progress towards your goals and to identify areas of success as well as areas in need of adjustment. Although only  you and your partner organization can view the information in OPTA about your initiative, OPTA enables you to link your data to any of your partner organizations’ initiatives.</p>

<p>This manual summarizes how OPTA can be used to generate valuable results, but neither OPTA nor this manual is intended as a rigid set of processes or instructions. OPTA is designed to give users wide flexibility in designing and expressing their Theory of Action and selecting the indicators by which they are prepared to monitor their success.</p>

<p>OPTA also aims to leverage operators’ existing practices and to be responsive to the dynamic circumstances in which each operator works. It is assumed that operators will have suggestions for improving OPTA and this manual, and that both will be “living tools” that evolve in response to users experience with the system.</p>

<p>Finally, this manual is designed for users that have varying levels of experience with different components of OPTA, such as Theories of Action and performance indicators.  If you are already familiar with these components, please skim the sections that provide introductory or definitional material.  If you have questions, please feel free to contact us to clarify these concepts as they have been defined in this process.</p>
                        
                        
					  <h3>II. Step-by-Step Instructions</h3>
                      
<p>After logging in as a user and finding your Organization, OPTA will ask you to a) type in your organization’s Theory of Action, b) identify the Outcomes that you hope to achieve in each initiative, c) identify the Actions that you plan to undertake, or you assume others will undertake, in each initiative in order to generate those Outcomes, and d) specify the necessary Inputs for your work to be provided either by your organization.</p>

<div class="stepHead"><strong>STEP 1:</strong> Log in</div> 

<div class="stepHead"><strong>STEP 2:</strong> Search for your Organization</div> 

<p>(Make your organization’s page if none is found)</p> 

<div class="stepHead"><strong>STEP 3:</strong> Add an Initiative</div>  
<ul>
<li>3a. Input a Theory of Action </li>

<li>3b. Input Outcomes</li> 

<li>3c. Input Actions that support those outcomes</li>
                      </ul>
                      
                      
<div class="stepHead"><strong>STEP 1:</strong> Logging in</div> 

<div class="stepHead"><strong>STEP 2:</strong> Search for your Organization</div> 

<div class="stepHead"><strong>STEP 3:</strong> Add an Initiative</div> 

<div class="stepHead"><strong>STEP 3a:</strong> Input a Theory of Action</div> 

<p>On the Theory of Action worksheet, insert your organization’s Theory of Action using the two key steps for creating a Theory of Action:</p>

<div class="stepBox"><strong>Step One:</strong>  Articulate a clear and measurable objective.</div>  

<div class="stepBox"><strong>Step Two:</strong>  State the actions that, together, will achieve that objective.</div> 

<p>The Theory of Action should: </p>

<p class="setOff">- Reflect your organization’s mission specific to your sponsored work (please note that this may differ from your organization’s broader mission)</p>

<p class="setOff">- Be relatively stable throughout the initiative </p>

<p>Use the guidelines provided to craft a Theory of Action specific to your Public Square-sponsored work. Enter Theory of Action in text box provided.</p> 

<div class="stepHead"><strong>STEP 3b:</strong> Input Outcomes</div> 

<p>Starting here, the logic model of Actions  Outcomes is organized in reverse order as a backwards-mapping exercise, starting with the Outcomes you plan to achieve in this school.</p> 

<p>Below is a screenshot of where you will specify your Outcomes for a specific initiative. The blue text provides an example of an Outcome and other data that an operator might type into this worksheet.</p> 

<div class="stepBox"><strong>Step A.</strong> Specify the Outcome (or one of the Outcomes) that you plan to achieve.</div> 

<div class="stepBox"><strong>Step B.</strong>  List up to three metrics that you will use to track whether or not you achieved, or made progress toward achieving, your desired Outcome. Choose metrics for which your organization will have access to the data.</div> 

<div class="stepBox"><strong>Step C.</strong>  At the start of your initiative, specify your mid- and end-of- initiative goals for each metric you choose.</div> 

<div class="stepBox"><strong>Step E.</strong> At the mid- and end-point of your initiative, report your actual results for the specified metric.</div> 


<h3>OUTCOME</h3> 

<p>To add an additional Outcome and associated Actions, click this box. An additional row will appear in the worksheet.</p> 

<div class="stepBox"><strong>Step D.</strong> Metrics may need to change over the course of the initiative.</div> 

<p>At the mid- and end-points of the initiative, indicate whether you have made any revisions to the metric. Use the drop-down menu to specify whether you refined, added, or deleted a metric. Explain any changes you made using the comment boxes below.</p>

<p>If you no longer use a metric, please mark “Delete” in the drop-down menu, but do not remove the metric. If you want to add a metric, add a new row, write the metric in the space to the left, and select “Add” in the drop-down menu. If you have made changes to how you collect or define a metric, rewrite the metric text to reflect those changes and indicate “Revised” in the drop-down menu.</p> 

<div class="stepBox"><strong>Step F.</strong>  At the mid- and end-points of your initiative, indicate whether you exceeded, met, or missed your goal for each metric.

Indicate “NA” if you made substantive revisions to the metric such that your initial goals no longer apply.</div> 

<div class="stepBox"><strong>STEP 3c:</strong> Input Actions that support those outcomes</div> 

<h3>Actions</h3>

<p>To the right of each Outcome, insert at least one and up to five Actions that your organization or some other party (for example school or district personnel) will undertake to help achieve that Outcome. There is also space for you to list the party or parties (your organization and/or someone else) that is responsible for executing the Action. You will be able to decide and report whether goals were on-track, on-going, or missed, or if changes were made to the metric based on your subjective judgment.</p>

<p>If achieving that Outcome will require more than five Actions, you may add additional Actions. Attributing Actions to someone or some organization besides your own signifies that you and that party have formally or informally agreed on everyone’s respective responsibilities. Together, all of the Actions listed should reasonably be expected to produce the associated Outcome.</p>

<p>The screenshot below shows how to enter this information. Again, the blue text provides an example of information an operator might provide, in this case about Actions.</p>

<div class="stepBox"><strong>Step A.</strong> Specify the Actions you will undertake. Select Actions that can be reasonably expected to help achieve the Outcome.</div> 

<div class="stepBox"><strong>Step B.</strong>  Identify the party or parties responsible for performing this Action.</div> 

<div class="stepBox"><strong>Step E.</strong>  At the mid- and end-points, report for each metric whether you have needed to make any changes, including refining, adding, or deleting metrics. Provide the reason for the change in the Comments box below. Follow instructions outlined above for adding, deleting, or refining metrics.</div> 

<div class="stepBox"><strong>Step C.</strong>  Specify up to three metrics you will track to evaluate whether or not the Action is being executed successfully. Select metrics that draw on data to which your organization has ready access.</div>

<div class="stepBox"><strong>Step D.</strong> For each metric, provide the existing amount or status at the beginning of the initiative and the benchmarks or goals you are setting for the mid- and end-points of the initiative.</div> 

<div class="stepBox"><strong>Step F.</strong>  For each metric, report your actual results at the mid- and end-points of the initiative. In comments, you can provide any context you believe will help Public Square understand your results.</div> 

<div class="stepBox"><strong>Step G.</strong>  For each metric, at the mid- and end-point of initiative, indicate whether you met, exceeded, or missed your goal. Indicate “NA” if you made changes to the metric.</div> 

<h3>Inputs</h3> 

<p>Below the Outcomes and Actions section, indicate the Inputs (resources or preconditions) that are necessary for your organization to be successful in executing the Theory of Action in this school. These Inputs should be factors that are logically necessary for the planned Actions to actualize in this school. Also indicate the party or parties responsible for providing the Input.</p> 

<p>Attributing an Input to a party other than you organization signifies that you and that party have formally or informally agreed upon the relevant division of responsibilities for providing Inputs.</p> 

<p>These Inputs include grants, personnel, and general conditions for success such as access to data and facilities. Together, all of the Inputs listed should be sufficient, in conjunction with the specified Actions, to produce the associated Outcome.</p> 

<div class="stepBox"><strong>Step B:</strong>  Specify the Inputs or resources that you are investing into this school from your own organization.</div> 

<div class="stepBox"><strong>Step C:</strong>  Specify the Inputs or resources that you are expecting to receive from external parties.</div> 

<div class="stepBox"><strong>Step D:</strong>  Specify the external parties (individual or group) responsible for providing the Input.</div> 


<div class="stepBox"><strong>Step E.</strong>  At the mid- and end-points of the initiative, use the drop-down menu to indicate whether that Input was adequately provided.</div>
