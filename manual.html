						<h3>Overview</h3>
						<p>
This manual is designed to guide you through the process of using OPTA to describe your 
organization’s Theory of Action for an initiative. This manual will also walk you through the steps to articulate the outcomes you hope to achieve, to understand how your work relates to your initiatives broader objectives, and to define a clear and measurable strategy to achieve your stated outcomes.</p>

<p>The process begins by giving you the chance to articulate a Theory of Action that describes the Inputs, Actions, and intended Outcomes of your initiative and how they relate to your 
desired Impact. The process also asks you to identify the metrics and indicators you will track to assess your progress against your goals.  Together, you and your partner organization will monitor the indicators you have chosen to track progress towards your goals and to identify areas of success as well as areas in need of adjustment. Although only  you and your partner organization can view the information in OPTA about your initiative, OPTA enables you to link your data to any of your partner organizations’ initiatives.</p>

<p>This manual summarizes how OPTA can be used to generate valuable results, but neither OPTA nor this manual is intended as a rigid set of processes or instructions. OPTA is designed to give users wide flexibility in designing and expressing their Theory of Action and selecting the indicators by which they are prepared to monitor their success.</p>

<p>OPTA also aims to leverage operators’ existing practices and to be responsive to the dynamic circumstances in which each operator works. It is assumed that operators will have suggestions for improving OPTA and this manual, and that both will be “living tools” that evolve in response to users experience with the system.</p>

<p>Finally, this manual is designed for users that have varying levels of experience with different components of OPTA, such as Theories of Action and performance indicators.  If you are already familiar with these components, please skim the sections that provide introductory or definitional material.  If you have questions, please feel free to contact us to clarify these concepts as they have been defined in this process.</p>
