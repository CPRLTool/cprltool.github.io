						<h3>I.  Theory of Action

What is a Theory of Action?</h3>
						<p>

A Theory of Action describes the relationship between an organization’s actions and the 

outcomes it hopes to achieve. It communicates an organization’s primary objective—its 

raison d’être—and the strategy it expects to follow to fulfill that objective. Designing an 

effective Theory of Action requires two critical steps: 

Step One:  Articulate a clear and measurable objective. 

Step Two:  State the actions that, together, will achieve that objective. 

These first two steps can be embodied in an “if-then” statement: 

If we do “X Action”… … and “Y Action” … … then we will achieve

“Z Objective.” 

For example, here is an expression of “Organization A’s” Theory of Action:

If Organization A 

attracts high-performing 

teachers... 

…that effectively 

support schools and 

districts... 

…then Organization A will 

improve achievement 

among underserved 

students. 

An effective Theory of Action…

… is relatively stable but subject to modification. An organization’s Theory of 

Action will rarely change drastically over time, but an effective Theory of Action 

statement should invite multiple, iterative modifications. As a Theory of Action is 

implemented and data points are collected, the Theory of Action statement should be 

updated, as relevant, to reflect lessons learned. For example, an organization may at 

first silently assume a necessary precondition to the effective operation of its actions 

or a supplemental link between those actions and the intended outcome. Alternatively, 

that organization may silently expect certain prerequisites to be put in place by 

someone else. When the absence of that action or link contributes to the failure of the 

organization’s actions to generate their intended effect, the organization will realize 

that its Theory of Action—and the practical steps it or others must take—will have to 

change in order to supply the missing prerequisite. Through this iterative process of 

change, the Theory of Action gains precision and accuracy, and the organization is 

better able to implement and evaluate strategies. 

… includes measurable actions and objectives. The Theory of Action should be 

premised on actions and objectives that can be measured in a meaningful way. Even if 

the most accurate and valid metrics may not be available, using strong proxies can help 

an organization evaluate and track progress along their Theory of Action.

… contemplates both leading and lagging indicators of success. Often, an 

organization’s program and services are offered in pursuit of meaningful long-term 

impact that takes time to actualize. A Theory of Action should therefore contemplate 

some leading indicators that are reasonably strong predictors of the desired long-term 

impact. Conversely, if an organization’s program and services are focused almost 

entirely on producing short-term results, it is critical to consider the long-term 

implications of such results.

… demonstrates a causal relationship between actions and objectives, as well as 

leading and lagging indicators of success. The Theory of Action statement should 

present what at first is a theory of a causal relationship between actions and outcomes. 

An organization’s goals and objectives should be logically connected to, and causally 

linked to, the organization’s primary activities and actions. The iterative process of 

change described above reflects the organization’s acquisition of knowledge about 

how its causal theory lines up with—and can be changed to line up better with—actual 

practice.

What indicators may be used to track progress implementing a Theory of Action? 

An organization’s ultimate impact varies based on its mission. 

In some cases, an organization may hope its ultimate impact 

will be improved school leadership, teacher instruction, 

parent initiative, or school level finances. In other cases, 

improvements in student test scores, high school graduation 

rates, or success in the first year of college might be the 

desired impact. Each of these is a lagging indicator, which is 

used to mark the achievement of the organization’s long-term 

goals and may take several years to actualize. Lagging 

indicators are necessary, of course, but often will not provide 

information that is sufficiently timely and contextualized to 

reveal the short- and mid-term success of an organization’s 

work—i.e., whether the intermediate changes the 

organization expects to occur, in order to set the stage for or 

drive the ultimate impacts, are occurring. Organization’s 

lagging indicators are not always expected to align with Public 

Square’s Impact measures, but may directly or indirectly 

affect them.

Determining whether the important intermediate changes 

and effects are occurring, which in turn helps to predict future 

change in a lagging indicator, requires the use of leading 

Lagging Indicator 

Reveals success achieving long-

term goals and confirms trends

May be used to confirm or 

contradict expected outcomes 

and effectiveness of programs 

Leading Indicator 

Reveals if a Theory of Action is 

being implemented well

Provides timely and 

contextualized information that 

can drive short- and mid-term 

adjustments to actions

Predicts future change in a 

lagging indicator 

indicators. For example, because increases in student attendance or decreases in teacher 

absenteeism often correlate with increases in student achievement, an organization’s 

Theory of Action may call for efforts to improve student attendance and reduce teach 

absenteeism, with the expectation that increases in student achievement will follow. In that 

case, changes in a school’s average student attendance and teacher absenteeism rates can 

serve as leading indicators of success that reveal whether the organization’s Theory of 

Action is being implemented properly and provide an early indication of whether student 

achievement levels can be expected to improve in the following months or even years.</p>

								<h3>Part 2: How to Use OPTA</h3>
								<p> After logging in as a user and finding your Organization, OPTA will ask you to a) type in your organization’s Theory of Action, b) identify the Outcomes that you hope to achieve in each initiative, c) identify the Actions that you plan to undertake, or you assume others will undertake, in each initiative in order to generate those Outcomes, and d) specify the necessary Inputs for your work to be provided either by your organization.
