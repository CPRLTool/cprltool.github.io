						<h3>II.  Evaluative Framework: Inputs, Actions, Outcomes, and Impact</h3>
						<p>The following is a brief description of the Evaluative Framework components:

Inputs

Inputs are the resources necessary to implement Actions, or the preconditions for your work. 

Inputs include financial information, such as the amount of funding, and may also include your 

organization’s and external parties’ commitments of time and personnel. For example, an 

organization may require salaries for five full-time staff members. You may also need to identify 

Inputs expected from districts, school leaders and staff, and other third parties that are 

necessary for the full and effective implementation of all Actions, such as weekly meetings with 

school principals or classroom space. Attributing an Input to an external party signifies that you 

have made the necessary arrangements with the other party to assure that Inputs are provided. 

Actions

Actions are tangible work or activities necessary to achieve desired outcomes. In addition to 

articulating Actions, you must also select indicators that measure the implementation of those 

Actions. For example, an Action may be training principals to be instructional leaders. 

Implementation of this Action may be measured by tracking the number of principal classroom 

observations, and the average time spent providing feedback to teachers. If necessary, Actions 

may need to be attributed to districts, school leaders and staff, and other third parties in order to 

achieve desired outcomes. Attributing an Action to an external party signifies that you have 

made the necessary arrangements with the other party to assure that the Actions occur.

Outcomes

Outcomes are the expected short- and mid-term effects of the Actions. In addition to defining 

Outcomes, you must also select indicators to measure whether the Outcomes are materializing 

as planned. These Outcomes may be leading indicators, such as measuring the effectiveness of 

training principals to be instructional leaders by surveying teachers about the quality of 

observations and feedback sessions. They also may be lagging indicators, such as measuring 

the effectiveness of tutoring sessions and workshops designed for the lowest-performing 

students by calculating the gap in test scores between the highest and lowest performing 

students.

Indicators tracking Actions and indicators tracking Outcomes differ in the following respect. 

Action indicators measure whether an Action is implemented, (for example, counting the 

number of feedback sessions), but do not speak to the quality of a given Action. Outcome 

metrics assess the effectiveness of an Action. This enables you and your partner organization to 

differentiate between Actions that are ostensibly ineffective simply because they are not 

occurring and Actions that are actually ineffective. In such a case, the Actions are undertaken, 

but they simply do not lead to the expected Outcome.

Impact

Impact is the long-term result of initiatives across a portfolio of funded initiatives. By engaging 

with your organization, your organizing partner (usually a funder) has made the judgment that 

your organizational objectives, or Outcomes, sufficiently link to their Impact.

Your Theory of Action should link your organization’s work with these Impact measures. For 

example, although providing breakfast to students in the morning may not directly have an effect 

on test scores, a Theory of Action can demonstrate how ensuring that students are nourished in 

the morning will influence their ability to pay attention in class, to retain information and learn, 

and thus to raise their scores.  Conversely, your work may be focused entirely on raising 

student achievement, thus overlapping your desired Outcomes with your organizing partner’s 

Impact. 

What is the value of this evaluative framework?

One value of the evaluative framework is to diagnose weaknesses, hidden assumptions, or 

missing steps in a Theory of Action based on collected data. Although the “theory” driving the 

Theory of Action may draw upon well-established social science and research or hard-won 

practical experience, it may lack precision and accuracy in a given setting. The Theory of Action 

may be incomplete due to failure to identify hidden assumptions—often about what external 

stakeholders must do for an organization’s Actions to mature into Impacts. The evaluative 

framework in OPTA is designed as a logic model to test, as well as implement, the Theory of 

Action under a particular set of circumstances. 

In order to have a Theory of Action that effectively links Inputs to Impact, each step along the 

evaluative framework must be logically connected to the following step. In other words, the 

Inputs should include all of the logically necessary resources for executing the Actions; the 

Actions—by themselves and without other unstated activities—can be reasonably expected to 

produce the Outcomes; and the Outcomes are reasonably expected to lead to the Impact. 

Identification of the critical elements in a Theory of Action enables an organization to test 

whether there are gaps in the contemplated chain of activities.

The evaluative framework helps diagnose mistaken assumptions about a link between a 

specified action and its intended result; such assumptions must be made explicit for the strategy 

to be successful. For example, a stated Action may be to conduct professional development 

sessions, and the success—or, the desired Outcome—of these sessions may require a 

particular level of teacher participation. If so, and assuming that teacher participation is the 

responsibility of the relevant school or district, not the organization itself, this condition or Input 

must be explicitly stated. Otherwise, if the desired Outcome does not materialize from these 

professional development sessions, though the organization seems to have fulfilled all of the 

Actions it specified in the logic model, both the organization and Public Square will find it difficult 

to diagnose and resolve the problem.</p>
