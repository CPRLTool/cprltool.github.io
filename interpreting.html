<p>Analyzing the leading and lagging indicators you choose to input into OPTA can reveal:</p>

<ol><li>That the logic behind an initiative’s Theory of Action may be incorrect.</li>

<ul><li>i. In this situation, there is no indication that the organizing or implementing partner 

has failed to state or implement the necessary Outcomes and Actions. However, 

despite faithful implementation and sufficient planning, as indicated by “on-track” 

goals on Actions in OPTA, one or more Outcomes fail to demonstrate success. 

This combination of events—adequate implementation but inadequate 

results—may suggest that the logic behind an initiative’s Theory of Action is 

flawed. All hypothesized Actions and Inputs have been supplied, but the 

expected change has not been achieved.</li></ul> 

<li>That Actions necessary for an initiative’s Theory of Action to succeed in generating the 

desired Outcomes have been omitted for one or more of the following reasons:</li> 

<ul><li>i. A partner did not recognize the importance of those Actions. Similar to the above, </li>

<li>ii. A partner recognized the importance of Actions and stated in OPTA that such 

this scenario contemplates that all stated Actions have been faithfully 

implemented. The partners should ask if there are any unstated Inputs or Actions 

necessary for successful execution of the Theory of Action. 

Actions should be met, but assumed another party would execute those Actions 

while failing to state that such other party was responsible. </li>
</ul>
<li>That there may be problems with the rigor of implementation for an partner for one or 

more of the following reasons:</li>

<ul><li>i. A partner has failed to adequately carry out the Actions capture in OPTA. The 

Action metrics in OPTA may provide indications of lack of implementation rigor. 

Performance may be below expectations, simply put, because a partner did not 

do what they said they were going to do in an initiative.</li></ul>

<li>That additional or different partners are necessary to improve the current portfolio of 

initiatives and increase the organizing partner’s (usually, a funder’s) Impact.</li>

<ul><li>i. This situation concerns an organizing partner’s aggregate Impact. Analysis of the 

system’s leading indicators or lagging indicators may reveal that the current “mix” 

of initiatives in the portfolio will not or has not contributed to increased Impact 

achievement.</li></ul> 

<li>That in a situation in which the desired Impacts or Outcomes are not yet materializing, 

positive signals being received from the leading indicators suggest more time is needed 

for Impacts and Outcomes to catch up to effective implementation. Conversely, negative 

signals from leading indicators may suggest that ample time has already been given, 

that a new strategy should be employed, or that a relationship with a partner should be 

terminated.</li></ol>
